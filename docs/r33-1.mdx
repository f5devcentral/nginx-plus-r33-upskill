## Welcome

Welcome to the NGINX Plus R33 Upskill Lab.

There will not be a live session for this upskill session and all content will provided in this lab.

### Agenda

The goals of this upskill session are:

1. Demonstrate licensing changes starting with NGINX Plus R33

---

## NGINX Plus R33

### Background

The NGINX Plus Release 33 requires that all instances have a valid **JSON Web Token (JWT)** license. The license is linked
to the subscription but not the individual instance of NGINX Plus. The NGINX Plus instance will also automatically send
usage reports to F5â€™s licensing endpoint **product.connect.nginx.com**.  The usage reports are a requirement of all current
license agreements. In the case of environments with no direct access to F5 licensing endpoint customers can generate the
reports using NGINX Instance Manager or use NGINX Instance Manager to proxy the reports to the F5 licensing endpoint.

All NGINX Plus customers (new and existing) are required to include the entitlement artifact **JWT** in their NGINX Plus
installation.  The JWT can be downloaded from the MyF5 account associated to the NGINX Plus license. There is a built-in
90-day grace period at the end of all NGINX Plus subscriptions.

> **Note:** No application traffic would be impacted even after the grace period expiration until NGINX is restarted.

In addition to having a valid JWT included in the NGINX Plus installation, each instance is required to submit a report at
least once every 180 days to prevent NGINX from dropping new connections. The usage reports are submitted by default to
**product.connect.nginx.com**. NGINX Plus installs without access to the F5 licensing endpoint can submit them to NGINX
Instance Manager. The NGINX Instance Manager can send the reports to the F5 licensing endpoint or the Administrator can
generate the report manually and submit it to the F5 licensing endpoint.

### Data Reported by NGINX

NGINX Plus will collect and report following data starting with R33. This data is encrypted and sent from each NGINX instance to
the F5 licensing endpoint or NIM which can then send the data to the F5 licensing endpoint or the Administrator can manually
generate the report and submit it to F5.

- NGINX version
- NGINX App Protect Status
- Instance UniqueID
- Bytes received by/sent to clients (http, stream)
- Number of requests handled (http)
- Bytes received from and sent to upstreams (http, stream)
- Number of accepted connections (http, stream)
- Number of workers running at the time of report
- K8s nodes count (in case of NIC)
- NGINX Uptime (in seconds)
- NGINX Reloads during uptime
- Collection start and end time.

### Submitting NGINX Usage Report

The following are three options that can be used for reporting NGINX usage to the F5 Licensing Endpoint:

1. NGINX Plus with internet access reports to F5
1. NGINX Plus managed by a connected NGINX Instance Manager (NIM) with internet access reports to F5
1. NGINX Plus managed by a disconnected NGINX Instance Manager (NIM). Steps for submitting report consists of:
    - Downloading NGINX usage report from NIM
    - Submitting NGINX usage report to F5
    - Download NGINX usage report status from F5
    - Submit usage report status to NIM

Take a look at the diagram below that shows the entire view of all options available.

![R33 License Options](media/intro/1.png)

On the NGINX Plus R33 instance, you have two endpoints available for configuring usage report:
1. SaaS **product.connect.nginx.com**
1. On-Prem via NIM

#### Option 1: NGINX Plus connected to internet

You can refer to the path shown as Option 1 in the diagram above. This is the simplest of the three, there are no
restrictions for the NGINX Plus instance and it can connect to the Reporting Endpoint directly. You are not required to
take any manual actions for submitting the usage report.

#### Option 2a: NGINX Plus managed by NIM connected to internet

In situations where the NGINX Plus instance is not directly be connected to the internet or it blocked from connecting
to **product.connect.nginx.com** option 2a may be a valid option. If this design your NGINX Plus instance managed by NIM is
connected to the internet. NIM then reports your NGINX Plus usage to the F5 License Server automatically. Like Option 1
you are not required to take any manual actions when submitting the usage report.

#### Option 2b: NGINX Plus and NIM fully disconnected

If your security policies require a fully disconnected environment, your NGINX Plus instance MUST be managed by NIM. So
in this case NGINX Plus and NIM are completely disconnected from the internet. The administrator will manually generate
the NGINX plus usage report and submit it to **product.connect.nginx.com** and then download the resulting report status and
submit it to NIM.

### Connection details for connected environments

When implementing option 1 or 2a you will have to allow egress traffic from either the NGINX Plus instance or NIM
to **product.connect.nginx.com**

| Type     | Value                     |
| -------- | -----------------------   |
| Port     | 443                       |
| Protocol | HTTPS                     |
| Hostname | product.connect.nginx.com |

### Workflow

There are three workflows that happens throughout the NGINX Plus lifetime

1. NGINX Startup Check
1. NGINX License Expiration Check
1. NGINX Usage Reporting Check


## Upskill session layout

In these sessions, we are breaking the labs into into the following sections below.

- Demo
- Interactive
- Fix It

### Demo

You will watch a video where we will show you one way of configuring the license endpoint to an F5 License Server.

### Interactive

Participants may need to update configuration files in order to get a working solution.

### Fix it

The last portion will be the Fix It Lab where the participants are to deploy a broken solution and
then using their validation and troubleshooting knowledge solve the mystery.

### Environment

The diagram of the lab environment is shown below.

![](media/intro/2.png)

A total of 3 systems will be available.
1. Lab Framework
1. NGINX Plus Instance (for fresh R33 install)
1. NGINX Plus Instance (for R33 upgrade)
1. NGINX Instance Manager

The **Lab Framework** contains the following
- this Lab Guide

> :warning: **Note:** The UDF environment does not support a true disconnected environment. So when we do the
interactive lab, we will go through steps as if NGINX Plus and NIM are not connected to the internet but do note they
have internet connectivity.

## Use Cases

For the NGINX Plus R33 release, there will only be one use case:

1. Entitlement and Visibility (E&V), aka licensing NGINX Plus

In each of the labs, we will be going over the different ways of handing E&V:

1. NGINX Plus connected directly to F5 Licensing Endpoint
1. Air-gapped environment where NGINX Plus is connected to NIM

## Up next

Let's now go right into the Demo where we you will watch a video where we license the NGINX Plus instance, [click here](r33-2.mdx).
