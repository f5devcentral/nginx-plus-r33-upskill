## Welcome

Welcome to the NGINX Plus R33 Upskill Lab.

There will not be a live session for this upskill session and all content will provided in this lab.

### Agenda

The goals of this upskill session are:

1. Changes starting on NGINX Plus R33

## NGINX Plus R33

### Background

In the past, F5 had minimal visibility with compliant usage checks or entitlement enforcement from customers using NGINX
Plus. F5 sellers, renewal, and support teams struggle understanding NGINX Plus usage and how many customers are using NGINX Plus
beyond their entitlement expiration in a non-compliant way. This leads to fewer than expected renewals causing the NGINX
usage to be over-reported while also reducing potential NGINX revenue opportunity.

NGINX Plus Release 33 is addressing this product gap by introducing out of the box enforcement and usage reporting
capabilities. The visibility and insights from this data would allow F5 sellers to be much more informed and effective
in new as well as renewal opportunities for NGINX.

As a pre-requisite, access to a valid subscription entitlement artifact (JWT) is now mandatory for NGINX to run.
All NGINX customers (new and existing) are required to deploy the entitlement artifact (JWT) obtainable from their MyF5
account prior to running NGINX. A 90-day grace period at the end of subscription expiration would be provided to renew
NGINX subscription. Note that no application traffic would be impacted even after the grace period expiration until
NGINX is restarted.

This artifact would also be used to enforce reporting of NGINX commercial usage data to F5. R33 would require all
connected customers to report their NGINX usage to the F5 licensing endpoint (product.connect.nginx.com), or in case of
disconnected customers, to NGINX Instance Manager (NIM). There is an opt-in 180 day reporting grace period to provide
flexibility to configure NGINX to report its usage. Consecutive non-reporting beyond 180 days would cause NGINX to stop
accepting any new connections.

### Data Reported by NGINX

NGINX Plus would collect and report following data starting R33. This data is sent encrypted from each NGINX instance to
the F5 licensing endpoint or NIM which further makes the data available to F5.

- NGINX version
- NGINX App Protect Status
- Instance UniqueID
- Bytes received by/sent to clients (http, stream)
- Number of requests handled (http)
- Bytes received from and sent to upstreams (http, stream)
- Number of accepted connections (http, stream)
- Number of workers running at the time of report
- K8s nodes count (in case of NIC)
- NGINX Uptime (in seconds)
- NGINX Reloads during uptime
- Collection start and end time.

### Submitting NGINX Usage Report

The following are three options one can use for reporting NGINX usage to the F5 Licensing Endpoint:

1. NGINX Plus with internet access reports to F5
1. NGINX Plus managed by a connected NGINX Instance Manager (NIM) with internet access reports to F5
1. NGINX Plus managed by a disconnected NGINX Instance Manager (NIM). Steps for submitting report consists of:
    - Downloading NGINX usage report from NIM
    - Submitting NGINX usage report to F5
    - Download NGINX usage report status from F5
    - Submit usage report status to NIM

#### NGINX Plus connected to internet

Outline below show how this reporting option. This one is the most simplest of the three

#### NGINX Plus managed by NIM connected to internet

If you choose not to connect your NGINX Plus instance directly to the F5 License Server, you have the option of having
your instance managed by NIM that is connected to the internet. NIM then reports your NGINX Plus usage directly to the
F5 License Server automatically.

TODO: Add diagram

#### Fully disconnected environment

If your security policies require a fully disconnected environment, your NGINX Plus instance MUST be managed by NIM. So
in the case here, NGINX Plus and NIM is completely disconnected from the internet. Instead of letting your NGINX Plus
instance or NIM handing the usage report, you will be required to handle this work.

### Connection details for connected environments

Whether you decide to setup reporting from the NGINX Plus instance or NIM, you must allow ingress and egress firewall
rules to allow the following connection.

| Type     | Value                     |
| -------- | -----------------------   |
| Port     | 443                       |
| Protocol | HTTPS                     |
| Hostname | product.connect.nginx.com |

### Workflow

There are three workflows that happens throughout the NGINX Plus lifetime

1. NGINX Startup Check
1. NGINX License Expiration Check
1. NGINX Usage Reporting Check


## Upskill session layout

In these sessions, we are breaking the labs into into the following sections below.

- Demo
- Interactive
- Fix It

### Demo

You will watch a video where we will show you one way of configuring the license endpoint to an F5 License Server.

### Interactive

Participants may need to update configuration files in order to get a working solution.

### Fix it

The last portion will be the Fix It Lab where the participants are to deploy a broken solution and
then using their validation and troubleshooting knowledge solve the mystery.

### Environment

The diagram of the lab environment is shown below.

![](media/upskill/presentation-3.png)

A total of 3 systems will be available.
1. Lab Framework
1. NGINX Plus Instance (for fresh R33 install)
1. NGINX Plus Instance (for R33 upgrade)
1. NGINX Instance Manager

The **Lab Framework** contains the following
- this Lab Guide

> :warning: **Note:** The UDF environment does not support a true disconnected environment. So when we do the
interactive lab, we will go through steps as if NGINX Plus and NIM are not connected to the internet but do note they
have internet connectivity.

## Use Cases

For the NGINX Plus R33 release, there will only be one use case:

1. Entitlement and Visibility (E&V), aka licensing NGINX Plus

In each of the labs, we will be going over the different ways of handing E&V:

1. NGINX Plus connected directly to F5 Licensing Endpoint
1. Air-gapped environment where NGINX Plus is connected to NIM

## Up next

Let's now go right into the Demo where we you will watch a video where we license the NGINX Plus instance, [click here](r33-2.mdx).
