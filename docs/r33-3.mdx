description: License NGINX Plus in a connected environment
order: 3

## Introduction

We will be going through a demo where you are in an environment connected to the internet. And because of this, we
configure NGINX Plus to submit usage reports directly to the F5 licensing endpoint.

## Demo Lab

Remember there are two areas introduced in NGINX Plus R33:
1. You must have a valid JWT and that JWT must be within the 90-day grace period for NGINX to start.
1. Once NGINX is started, a report must be submitted with an interval of at most 180 days.

This demo video will show the following parts:
1. Configuring NGINX Plus to connect to the F5 license endpoint
1. Show the new NGINX Plus behavior in regards to the JWT license
    - NGINX Plus startup without a JWT
    - NGINX Plus behavior as the expiration date nears
1. Show NGINX Plus behavior in regards to submitting the usage report
    - NGINX Plus behavior when a failure occurs when submitting the usage report but you are within the 180-day grace
    period
    - NGINX Plus behavior after the 180-day grace period

### NGINX Plus R33 on cloud

Clouds such as AWS and Azure have a subscription model in place so you will not need to worry about Entitlement &
Visibility (E&V). Reporting is also automatically disabled.

### NGINX Plus R33 in container

There are available environment variables relating to E&V when running NGINX Plus R33 as a container listed below.

| Variable | Default |
| -------- | ------- |
| NGINX_LICENSE_ENDPOINT | `product.connect.nginx.com` |
| NGINX_LICENSE_ENDPOINT_VERIFY | `yes` |
| NGINX_LICENSE_JWT | `/etc/nginx/license.jwt` |

An example of running NGINX Plus R33 in docker is below.

```shell
docker run -v $(PWD)/my-nginx-plus.jwt:/etc/nginx/license.jwt \
  -e NGINX_LICENSE_ENDPOINT="nim.mycompany.local" \
  -e NGINX_LICENSE_ENDPOINT_VERIFY=off
  private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-plus/base:nginx-plus-r33-debian-bookworm
```

## Summary

After watching this video, you now:
1. Understand how to configure the endpoint where the usage report is submitted.
1. Understand NGINX Plus with the JWT.
1. Understand NGINX Plus behavior with submitting the usage report.

## Up next

Now that you understand how to configure the reporting endpoint, let's proceed to the next lab where we will walk through
a scenario where the NGINX Plus instance does not have internet connectivity but an NGINX Instance Manager does.
