description: License NGINX Plus in a connected environment
order: 3
---

## Introduction

We will be going through a demo where you are in an environment connected to the internet. You can either:

1. Configure NGINX Plus to submit usage report directly to the F5 license server
1. Configure NGINX Plus to submit usage report to NGINX Instance Manager (NIM) which will submit the report to the F5
license server

This demo video will go through option 1. Shown below is a component diagram that shows an overview of how the
usage report is submitted.

## Demo Lab

Remember there are two areas introduced in NGINX Plus R33
1. You must have a valid JWT and that JWT must be within the 90-day grace period for NGINX to start.
1. Once NGINX is started, a report must be submitted with an interval of at most 180 days.

This demo video will show the following parts:
1. Configuring NGINX Plus to connect to the F5 license server
1. Show the new NGINX Plus behavior in regards to the JWT license.
    - NGINX Plus startup without a JWT.
    - NGINX Plus behavior as the expiration date nears.
1. Show NGINX Plus behavior in regards to submitting the usage report.
    - NGINX Plus behavior when a failure occurs when submitting the usage report but you are within the 180-day grace
    period.
    - NGINX Plus behavior after the 180-day grace period.

## Summary

After watching this video, you now understand:
1. How to configure the endpoint where the usage report is submitted.
1. Understand NGINX Plus with the JWT.
1. Understand NGINX Plus behavior with submitting the usage report.

### NGINX Plus R33 on cloud

Clouds such as AWS and Azure have a subscription model in place so you will not need to worry about E&V. Reporting is
also automatically disabled.

## Conclusion

Now that you understand how to configure the reporting endpoint, let's proceed to the next lab where we will walk through the steps for submitting the usage report to the F5 license server in a fully disconnected environment. [Click here](r33-4.mdx) to proceed to that.
