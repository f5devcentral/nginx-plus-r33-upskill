---

## Introduction

We will be going through a demo when you are in an environment connected to the internet. You can either:

1. Configure NGINX Plus to submit usage report directly to the F5 license server
1. Configure NGINX Plus to submit usage report to NIM which will submit the report to the F5 license server

This demo video will go through the option 1.

## Demo Lab

This demo video will show the following parts:
1. Configuring NGINX Plus to connect to F5 license server
1. Show NGINX behavior throughout the licensing lifetime.
    - NGINX Plus startup without JWT
    - NGINX Plus behavior before 90 day grace period
    - NGINX Plus behavior after 90 day grace period but under 180 day period
    - NGINX Plus behavior after 180 day period

## Summary

After watching this video, you now understand:
1. How to configure endpoint where to submit usage report.
1. Understand NGINX Plus behavior before 90 day grace period, after 90 day grace period, and after 180 day grace period.

## Conclusion

Now that you understand how to configure the reporting endpoint, let's proceed to the next lab where we will work on
steps for submitting the usage report to the F5 license server in a fully disconnected environment in the disconnected
lab. [Click here](r33-4.mdx) to proceed to that.
