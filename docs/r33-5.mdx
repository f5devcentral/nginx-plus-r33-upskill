description: Disconnected NGINX Plus E&V with disconnected NIM
order: 5
---

## Introduction

:bangbang: Be sure your UDF deployment is using at least *SDE NGINX Plus R33 Upskilling (**version 19**)*

We will be going through an interactive lab where you will be working on a scenario where the NGINX Plus instance
and the NGINX Instance Manager (NIM) are completely air-gapped. This is a disconnected environment where the
organization's security policy requires these two components to be disconnected from any access from the internet.

> NOTE: This lab is created in UDF and all components are connected to the Management network, which is routed
to the internet, by default. We will be going through the exercise here as if NIM and NGINX Plus are disconnected but
know they really have internet connectivity in this lab.

The diagram below shows the network overview of this portion of the lab. Again, NGINX Plus and NIM do have
internet connectivity but we will go through the lab as if they do not.

The diagram below shows the component view and a main workflow one would do from a **Jumphost**.

![Disconnected components](media/interactive/2.png)

## Prerequisites

1. NGINX R33 JWT

## Interactive Lab Part 2

Let's get into this. An overview of steps we will be doing in this lab are listed below.

1. Activate NIM, because license is only applied
1. Configure NGINX Plus so usage report endpoint is set to NIM
1. Handle submitting the usage report from a **Jumphost**, which has internet connectivity, to the F5 Licensing Endpoint

> The extra manual steps for submitting the usage report is automatically handled if NGINX Plus or NIM have internet
connectivity. But because we are covering a case where NGINX and NIM are in a restricted network, you must manually
complete these steps from a device that has internet connectivity.

> You have up to 180 days to submit a report to F5.

### NIM activation

Why is NIM being used in this scenario? Remember NGINX Plus R33 will require usage reports being sent to an F5 SaaS or
NIM endpoint. Because NGINX Plus is air-gapped, we must use NIM as the endpoint.

Why do we have to activate NIM? The scenario here also requires NIM to be air-gapped as well as NGINX Plus. The
license activation process happens automatically when it is connected to the internet but for this case, we must
manually handle the activation process. The steps here go through those manual steps.

This lab already has NIM installed with a license but it isn't activated. Let's look at the NIM UI to confirm this.

1. In your UDF Deployment, select the Component tab then find **NGINX Instance Manager 2.18 (Disconnected)**
  ![UDF Component](media/interactive/3.png)

1. Select **ACCESS** then **UI**. A new window should open taking you to the NIM UI.
  ![UDF NIM UI](media/interactive/4.png)

1. Select **Sign In** then provide the following credentials: admin / Password123!
  ![NIM Sign In](media/interactive/5.png)

1. In the top right corner, select the Settings icon and confirm you are on the Licenses menu on the left. Notice NIM is
already configured in **Disconnected Mode**. Also notice the warning message regarding License Activation.

  > Details for configuring NIM for **Disconnected Mode** can be found the in
  [Set the operation mode to disconnected](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-instance-manager/disconnected/offline-install-guide/#set-mode-disconnected)
  section of the NIM Offline Installation Guide.

  ![NIM Unlicensed](media/interactive/6.png)

Let's now go through the manual activation process.

1. Log into the **Web Shell** of your **Jumphost**.

1. We will save your NGINX R33 JWT as an environment variable for ease. This will be used as your auth token when making
REST API calls to the F5 Licensing Endpoint.
    ```shell
    export LICENSE=<PasteJWTValueHere>
    ```

1. We will also be saving the *Basic Authorization* token when making REST API calls to NIM. Any `curl` commands for NIM
will use this token.
    ```shell
    export NIM_AUTH_TOKEN=`echo -n "admin:Password123!" | base64`
    ```

1. Run the following command to download the initial usage report. In the example below, we are downloading the license
report to a file named `license_report.zip`.
    ```shell
    curl --location \
      'https://nim-disconnected.lab.f5npi.net/api/platform/v1/report/download?format=zip&reportType=initial&telemetryAction=download' \
      --header "Authorization: Basic $NIM_AUTH_TOKEN" \
      --output license_report.zip
    ```

1. Run the following command to submit the usage report to the  F5 Licensing Endpoint for verification.
    ```shell
    curl --location -s \
      'https://product.apis.f5.com/ee/v1/entitlements/telemetry/bulk' \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $LICENSE" \
      --form 'file=@"license_report.zip"' | jq
    ```

    :warning: Pay attention to the UUID of the *statusLink* value. You will be using this for future `curl`
    commands. In the example here, it is **7b926064-3360-4354-86d8-79b390efd178**. You can see an example response
    below.

    <Collapsible title="Example Output">
    ```shell
    root@lab-framework:/# curl --location -s \
      'https://product.apis.f5.com/ee/v1/entitlements/telemetry/bulk' \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $LICENSE" \
      --form 'file=@"license_report.zip"' | jq
    {
      "statusLink": "/ee/v1/entitlements/telemetry/bulk/status/7b926064-3360-4354-86d8-79b390efd178",

      "validUntilDate": "2024-11-06T23:33:29.853Z"
    }
    ```
    </Collapsible>

1. Run the command below to check if the report is successfully uploaded and if the acknowledgement report is ready for
download. Remember to swap out **\<report-id\>** for the **UUID** you got from the response when you submitted the usage
report to the F5 Licensing Endpoint.
    ```shell
    curl --location -s \
      'https://product.apis.f5.com/ee/v1/entitlements/telemetry/bulk/status/<report-id>' \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $LICENSE"  | jq
    ```

    <Collapsible title="Example Output">
    ```shell
    root@nim:~$ curl --location -s \
      'https://product.apis.f5.com/ee/v1/entitlements/telemetry/bulk/status/7b926064-3360-4354-86d8-79b390efd178' \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $LICENSE"  | jq
    {
      "percentageComplete": 100,
      "percentageSuccessful": 100,
      "readyForDownload": true,
      "downloadLink": "/ee/v1/entitlements/telemetry/bulk/download/7b926064-3360-4354-86d8-79b390efd178"
    }
    ```
    </Collapsible>

1. Run the following to download the license acknowledgment report from F5. In the example below, we are downloading the
report to a file named `lic_acknowledgement.zip`. Remember to swap out **\<report-id\>** for the **UUID** you got from
the response when you submitted the usage report to the F5 Licensing Endpoint.
    ```shell
    curl --location -s \
      'https://product.apis.f5.com/ee/v1/entitlements/telemetry/bulk/download/<report-id>' \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $LICENSE" \
      --output lic_acknowledgement.zip
    ```

1. Now finally, run the following to upload the license acknowledgment report to NIM.
    ```shell
    curl --location -s \
      'https://nim-disconnected.lab.f5npi.net/api/platform/v1/report/upload' \
      --header "Authorization: Basic $NIM_AUTH_TOKEN" \
      --form 'file=@"lic_acknowledgement.zip"' | jq
    ```

    <Collapsible title="Example Output">
    ```shell
    root@lab-framework:/# curl --location -s \
      'https://nim-disconnected.lab.f5npi.net/api/platform/v1/report/upload' \
      --header "Authorization: Basic $NIM_AUTH_TOKEN" \
      --form 'file=@"lic_acknowledgement.zip"' | jq

    {
      "manifest": "...",
      "message": "Report uploaded successfully."
    }
    ```
    </Collapsible>

1. You have now licensed NIM and submitted the initial usage report. Go back to your NIM UI and refresh your page.
Notice the License Activation warning is now gone.
  ![NIM Licensed](media/interactive/7.png)

> We've went through manual steps for activating NIM license and submitting the initial usage report. There is also
a script available on the
[Add a license in a disconnected environment](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-instance-manager/disconnected/add-license-disconnected-deployment/)
page from the NGINX Instance Manager documentation.

Let's proceed to setup NGINX Plus so the endpoint is going to NIM instead of the default `product.connect.nginx.com`
endpoint.

### Configure NGINX Plus report endpoint

The prerequisites for installing NGINX Plus is already setup so all you need to do is install it.

1. From UDF, open up a **Web Shell** for your **NGINX Plus R33 (Part 2)** instance.

1. Install NGINX Plus by running the commands below.
    ```shell
    apt update
    apt install nginx-plus
    ```

1. Create the JWT file at `/etc/nginx/license.jwt` using the JWT you got from MyF5 using your editor of choice. You can
do this by one of the following ways:
    - `echo '<contents of your JWT file>' > /etc/nginx/license.jwt`
    - You can also open a blank file named `/etc/nginx/license.jwt` and paste the contents of the JWT file.

1. Open `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` using your editor of choice.

1. On the bottom the file, you should notice the `mgmt` section is commented out. Update the config file with the
following **mgmt** section. We will be doing the following:
    - Set the **usage_report** endpoint to `nim-disconnected.lab.f5npi.net` which is our disconnected NIM instance.
    - Set a quicker **interval** so we can see the frequency in the NGINX logs.
    - Enable **ssl_verify** following instructions from the [Configure SSL verification for usage reporting with self-signed
    certificates](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-instance-manager/system-configuration/secure-traffic/#trusting-self-signed-certificates)
    guide.
    ```shell
    mgmt {
      usage_report endpoint=nim-disconnected.lab.f5npi.net interval=30s;
    }
    ```

    > **NOTE:** This environment uses a valid signed certificate from LetsEncrypt because we want to keep **ssl_verify**
    enabled. This is already setup and no actions are needed by you but if you want additional details enabling
    **ssl_verify** with NIM, click on the **Show** button below.

    <Collapsible title="Enabling SSL Verify with NIM Details">
    <br/>

    :warning: **No action needed for this lab**, this section just provides additional details.

    <br/>
    <br/>

    There are a two main methods of how you can enable **ssl_verify**.
    * Bring your own signed or self-signed certificate
    * Use the NIM provided self-signed certificate
    <br/>

    #### User provided signed or self-signed certificate

    This lab environment uses a valid signed certificate generated using [**LetsEncrypt**](https://letsencrypt.org). Of
    the certificates LetsEncrypt created, two are used: `fullchain.pem` and `privkay.pem`. These files are copied to
    the NIM instances located in `/etc/nms/letsencrypt`.

    <br/>
    <br/>

    The NIM SSL certificate configuration is then updated. A snippet of this is shown below.

    ```shell
    $ cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/nms-http.conf # NIM instance
    . . .
    # Main external HTTPS server
    server {
        . . .
        ssl_certificate         /etc/nms/letsencrypt/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key     /etc/nms/letsencrypt/privkey.pem;
    }
    ```

    If you wish to use your own provided self-signed certificate, the configuration steps shown above where you set the
    `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` is similar to using a signed certificate. Remember to either load your
    root CA of your self-signed certificate into your system or set it in your NGINX config. The snippet below is an
    example of configuring the NGINX R33 so it uses your root CA when usage reports are sent to NIM.

    ```shell
    $ cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf # NGINX Plus R33 instance
    . . .
    mgmt {
        ssl_trusted_certificate /path/to/self/signed/root/ca.pem;
    }
    ```

    > **NOTE:** The `ssl_trusted_certificate` directive from the
    [mgmt module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_mgmt_module.html) defaults to using the system CAs. So if the
    self-signed root CA is loaded into your system, you do not need to set `ssl_trusted_certificate`.

    <br/>

    #### NIM provided self-signed certificate

    If you wish to use the self-signed certificate generated by NIM, follow instructions from the
    [Configure SSL verification for usage reporting with self-signed certificates](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-instance-manager/system-configuration/secure-traffic/#trusting-self-signed-certificates)
    guide.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So here, the root CA certificate is copied from NIM to the NGINX Plus R33 instance and set using the
    `ssl_trusted_certificate` directive. In additional to that, you also need to set the `ssl_name` to
    **manager-server**. An snippet of the **mgmt** block looks like the following.

    ```shell
    mgmt {
      usage_report endpoint=nim-connected.local;
      ssl_trusted_certificate /full/path/to/ca/copied/from/nim/ca.pem;
      ssl_name manager-server;
    }
    ```
    </Collapsible>

1. On the top of the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file, change the `error_log` to `debug`. Below is the example where the
**error_log** is set to `debug`.
    ```shell
    error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log debug;
    ```

1. You can now save these changes.

1. Finally start NGINX Plus.

    ```shell
    systemctl start nginx
    ```

1. You should now notice the `info` line in `/var/log/nginx/error.log` showing the usage report was sent to NIM.

    <Collapsible title="Example Output">
    ```shell
    root@ip-10-1-1-5:~$ tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
    2024/10/31 07:20:58 [notice] 9833#9833: using the "epoll" event method

    2024/10/31 07:20:58 [info] 9835#9835: usage report was sent
    ```
    </Collapsible>

Great now you've setup your NGINX Plus instance so that it reports to NIM!

### Submitting usage report

By this point:
- NIM is licensed and activated.
- The initial report is submitted to the F5 Licensing Endpoint.
- NGINX Plus R33 is installed and is submitting usage reports to NIM.

We now need to submit the usage reports from NIM to the F5 License Server. We will now outline the steps to do this
below.

1. In UDF, open a **Web Shell** to the **Jumphost**.

1. Run the following command which renders the usage report on NIM.
    ```shell
    curl --location -s \
      'https://nim-disconnected.lab.f5npi.net/api/platform/v1/report/download?format=zip&reportType=telemetry' \
      --header 'accept: application/json' \
      --header "authorization: Basic $NIM_AUTH_TOKEN" \
      --header 'referer: https://nim-disconnected.lab.f5npi.net/ui/settings/license' | jq
    ```

    <Collapsible title="Example Output">

    ```shell
    root@lab-framework:/# curl --location -s \
      'https://nim-disconnected.lab.f5npi.net/api/platform/v1/report/download?format=zip&reportType=telemetry' \
      --header 'accept: application/json' \
      --header "authorization: Basic $NIM_AUTH_TOKEN" \
      --header 'referer: https://nim-disconnected.lab.f5npi.net/ui/settings/license' | jq

    {
      "telemetry":"Report generation in progress"
    }
    ```
    </Collapsible>

1. After a few seconds, run the following command below to download the report on to the **Jumphost**. In the example
here, the usage report is downloaded as a zip file named `usage.zip`.
    ```shell
    curl --location \
      'https://nim-disconnected.lab.f5npi.net/api/platform/v1/report/download?format=zip&reportType=telemetry&telemetryAction=download' \
      --header 'accept: */*' \
      --header "authorization: Basic $NIM_AUTH_TOKEN" \
      --output usage.zip
    ```

1. Run the following command to upload the report to the F5 License Endpoint.
    ```shell
    curl --location -s \
      'https://product.apis.f5.com/ee/v1/entitlements/telemetry/bulk' \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $LICENSE" \
      --form 'file=@"usage.zip"' | jq
    ```

    :warning: Pay attention to the UUID of the *statusLink* value. You will be using this for future `curl`
    commands. In the example here, it is **706812c5-32a7-41a4-bdf9-fec806b8f221**. You can see an example response
    below.

    <Collapsible title="Example Output">
    ```shell
    root@lab-framework:/# curl --location -s \
      'https://product.apis.f5.com/ee/v1/entitlements/telemetry/bulk' \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $LICENSE" \
      --form 'file=@"usage.zip"' | jq
    {
      "statusLink":"/ee/v1/entitlements/telemetry/bulk/status/706812c5-32a7-41a4-bdf9-fec806b8f221",
      "pollIntervalInSeconds":30,
      "validUntilDate":"2024-11-07T06:35:25.313Z"
    }
    ```
    </Collapsible>

1. Now check on status of the uploaded report. Remember to swap out **\<report-id\>** for the **UUID** you got from
the response when you submitted the usage report to the F5 Licensing Endpoint.

    ```shell
    curl --location -s \
      'https://product.apis.f5.com/ee/v1/entitlements/telemetry/bulk/status/<report_id>' \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $LICENSE" | jq
    ```

    <Collapsible title="Example Output">
    ```shell
    curl --location -s \
      'https://product.apis.f5.com/ee/v1/entitlements/telemetry/bulk/status/706812c5-32a7-41a4-bdf9-fec806b8f221' \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $LICENSE" | jq
    {
      "percentageComplete": 100,
      "percentageSuccessful": 100,
      "readyForDownload": true,
      "downloadLink": "/ee/v1/entitlements/telemetry/bulk/download/706812c5-32a7-41a4-bdf9-fec806b8f221"
    }
    ```
    </Collapsible>

1. The response from above should indicate the status report is ready for download. Run the following command to
download the license acknowledgement report from F5 Licensing Endpoint. The example command below will download the
report named `acknowledgement.zip`. Remember to swap in the **UUID** for **\<report_id\>**.

    ```shell
    curl --location \
      'https://product.apis.f5.com/ee/v1/entitlements/telemetry/bulk/download/<report_id>' \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $LICENSE" \
      --output acknowledgement.zip
    ```

1. Once your status report is downloaded, run the following command to upload it to NIM.

    ```shell
    curl --location -s \
      'https://nim-disconnected.lab.f5npi.net/api/platform/v1/report/upload' \
      --header "Authorization: Basic $NIM_AUTH_TOKEN" \
      --form 'file=@"acknowledgement.zip"' | jq
    ```

    <Collapsible title="Example Output">
    ```shell
    ubuntu@lab-framework:~$ curl --location -s \
      'https://nim-disconnected.lab.f5npi.net/api/platform/v1/report/upload' \
      --header "Authorization: Basic $NIM_AUTH_TOKEN" \
      --form 'file=@"acknowledgement.zip"' | jq
    {
      "manifest":"..",
      "message":"Report uploaded successfully."
    }
    ```
    </Collapsible>

You now submitted the usage report to F5! You will need to do this once at least every 180 days.

> We also went through the manual steps for:
> - Downloading the usage report from NIM and submitting it to the F5 Licensing Endpoint
> - Downloading the License Acknowledgment report from the F5 Licensing Endpoint and uploading it to NIM.
>
> There is an available script to do these manual steps in the
[Report usage to F5 in a disconnected environment](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-instance-manager/disconnected/report-usage-disconnected-deployment/)
guide from the NGINX Instance Manager documents.

## Logs

Let's now look at the logs. There are two components where you can view usage reporting logs when troubleshooting.

1. NGINX Plus Instance
1. NGINX Instance Manager

### NGINX Plus

Any logs messages relating to submitting usage reports from the NGINX Plus instance to NIM can be found in the
**error_log** directive. Since I am using the default values, it is located in `/var/log/nginx/error.log`.

If there are any issues when submitting the usage report, you will see **error** level logs.

You may also see **alert** level logs along with the error. Below is an example of an error when the NGINX Plus instance
failed to submit a report to NIM because it is unable to verify the TLS certificate.

```log
2025/04/03 20:53:45 [error] 2234#2234: certificate verify error: (21:unable to verify the first certificate) for 10.1.1.8:443 during usage report
2025/04/03 20:53:45 [alert] 2234#2234: cannot send usage report; traffic processing will degrade in 59 days
```

When the usage report is successfully submitted, you will see **info** level logs.

```log
2024/12/04 20:53:25 [info] 2234#2234: usage report was sent
```

### NGINX Instance Manager

Another area where you can look for log messages related to usage reports can be found on NIM. You may need to adjust
NIM's log level setting in `/etc/nms/nms.conf`. Below is an example of NIM's log config. Be sure to restart **nms** if
you made a change.
```yaml
log:
  level: debug
```

For the example here, I used the default log location in `/etc/nms/nms.log`.

If there are any issues submitting the usage report from NIM to the F5 Licensing Endpoint, you will see **WARN** and
**INFO** log messages coming from **DPM**. In my example here, I changed the time on the NGINX Plus instance to about
100 days in the future, command I ran shown below. This causes issues when the F5 Licensing Endpoint check timestamps.
```shell
sudo timedatectl set-ntp no && sudo date -s "+100 day"
```

Below is an example of the **WARN** and **INFO** log messages that resulted from changing the date.

```log
Nov 14 20:22:56 nim <DPM>[2667]: 2024-11-14T20:22:56.303Z	INFO	e3f55948-d3d7-4ff5-bcbc-96315529c988	usage/impl.go:200	failed to parse request body: bad request: end report time should not be before start time
Nov 14 20:22:56 nim <DPM>[2667]: 2024-11-14T20:22:56.303Z	WARN	e3f55948-d3d7-4ff5-bcbc-96315529c988	usage/impl.go:148	NGINX usage tracking: bad request: end report time should not be before start time, entry not created
```

You are also able to see **DEBUG** log messages when a report is successfully submitted to NIM from NGINX Plus.

```log
Nov 14 20:23:26 nim <DPM>[2667]: 2024-11-14T20:23:26.344Z	DEBUG	9813c201-6951-4926-98c1-c743fc17f1fa	usage/impl.go:163	NGINX usage tracking: new report with &{Version:1.27.2 Hostname:<nil> UUID:2159d15f-00d6-6684-8da1-a9680b2e5765 NAP:inactive DOS: ProductType:nginx-plus K8sClusterID:<nil> K8sInstallationID:<nil> JWTTokenID:0xc0011bb080 Time:2024-11-14 20:23:26.344311727 +0000 UTC m=+85.406709833}
```

## Summary

After completing this lab, can now:
1. Understand activating NIM and submitting the initial usage report to F5 Licensing Endpoint
1. Configure NGINX Plus to use NIM as the endpoint
1. Understand the process that must happen when submitting the usage report to the F5 Licensing Endpoint
1. Understand log locations for NGINX Instance and NIM for troubleshooting

## Up next

Now that you understand how to configure the reporting endpoint, let's proceed to the next lab where we will work on
a FixIt lab. [Click here](r33-6.mdx) to proceed to that.
